I'm a Solution Architect - Data Platform at Rackspace Technology with over 8 years of experience in the Data Engineering, Data Analytics and Cloud Architecture space. I specialize in designing and implementing Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Data Lakehouses, with a focus on migrating on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, leveraging Azure and AWS platforms.

With 4+ years of hands-on experience in Spark (Databricks), I have a strong command of building and optimizing big data pipelines. I am also well-versed in ERP systems, particularly SAP ECC, SAP HANA, and Oracle Fusion, which allows me to seamlessly integrate enterprise data into modern cloud architectures.

I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, and SQL, and I use these skills to solve complex data challenges and build scalable, resilient systems.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my work in action or connect with me for collaboration on exciting projects.
